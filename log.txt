I'm typing this on my new Raspberry Pi.  The idea for this project is to:

1. Set up the RPi on my bike so that I can cycle around and collect training data for the navigation neural network.
2. Train my navigation neural network.
3. Set up the RPi on my bike so that it will give me directions in some way (like on the screen or via headphones), to see if it is working.

4. If step (3) is doing reasonable things, add a steering motor to the bike and try riding without hands.  Perhaps.  Need to check on legality etc first.
5. 

So what is the structure of the program in step 1?  There will be a main loop, an overall state ... I think I am clear enough that I can go ahead and write some code.

I think the best place to start is to make a function for reading each of the sensors that I need.  Then I can go on to write the code.  The devices are:

1. The little screen and its buttons- not soldered on yet
2. the motion sensor - not soldered on yet
3. the web cams
4. the GPS reciever - at 8 Hazel
